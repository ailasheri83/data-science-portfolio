- 🏁 **Qualifying Results** - Positions achieved in qualifying rounds  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Python** (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for data exploration  
- **Git & GitHub** for version control  

## 📈 Key Insights  
1. 🇬🇧 **Britain has produced the most F1 drivers** historically.
